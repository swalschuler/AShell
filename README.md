A basic shell for UNIX systems. 

**Specifications of the VM**
=====
This is a program written in C++ which implements a fully functioning shell for UNIX systems.

Supported commands include:
* cd [directory]
* ls [directory]
 * Prints files/directories in the specified directory and also their permissions
* pwd 
* ff filename [directory]
 * Prints the path to all files matching the filename.

This project was created as a part of an operating systems class. As such, I can not post the source code. If you would like to view the code as part of a hiring process, please contact me personally. However, I can not under any circumstances provide source code to any student.
